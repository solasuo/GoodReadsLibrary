Database project simulating an electronic library.

Use the app on heroku: https://goodreads-library.herokuapp.com/

The library has two types of users: patrons and librarians. Every new user has the role of patron by default. 

A patron can:

- create an user account

- browse the library collection

- borrow books and return them (after borrowing, user is supposed to get access to the e-book but this function is not implemented here)

A librarian can:

- see the list of  all users and their roles

- add librarian's privileges to another user

- see the list of all loans and by whom they were borrowed

- add new books to the library collection

To use the librarian's functions, you may login with these credentials: 

username: Libby

password: Librarian1
